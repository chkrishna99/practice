  ICMP is a network-layer protocol.  

It is a companion to the IP protocol.  

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) defines a collection of error messages that are sent back to the source host whenever a router or host is unable to process an IP datagram successfully. 

ICMP MESSAGE TYPES  

ICMP messages are divided into two broad categories: error-reporting messages and query messages.  

The error-reporting messages report problems that a router or a host (destination) may encounter when it processes an IP packet.  

The query messages help a host or a network manager get specific information from a router or another host.

ICMP Error – Reporting Messages  

Destination Unreachable―When a router cannot route a datagram, the datagram is discarded and sends a destination unreachable message to source host.  

Source Quench―When a router or host discards a datagram due to congestion, it sends a source-quench message to the source host. This message acts as flow control. 

Time Exceeded―Router discards a datagram when TTL field becomes 0 and a time exceeded message is sent to the source host.  

Parameter Problem―If a router discovers ambiguous or missing value in any field of the datagram, it discards the datagram and sends parameter problem message to source.  

Redirection―Redirect messages are sent by the default router to inform the source host to update its forwarding table when the packet is routed on a wrong path.
